Development of nation starts only when rural development starts. Rural development is one of the major areas of prominence these days. Emerging technologies can provide the best solutions to the problems that are prevailing in the rural areas. Considering this fact we have chosen the following problem statement. As we are well aware that whenever a person visits bank he/she has to fill the withdrawal or deposit slips for money transaction as per the bank norms. This actually causes problem to the senior citizens and illiterates as the slips should be filled in English. Sometimes minute errors that are committed while filling the form makes the slip unacceptable which will lead to the wastage of time for both the individual and the bank. To overcome these difficulties and to make the process of money transactions simpler, smarter we will install two printing devices- one for the withdrawal and the other for the deposit.
